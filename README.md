# Introduction

This project explores the current landscape of data-related jobs in the U.S., focusing on the most in-demand skills, salary trends, and the evolving requirements for top data roles. By analyzing job postings and salary data, the project provides actionable insights for aspiring and current data professionals.

# Overview

The analysis covers three main areas:
- **Skill Demand:** Identifies the most sought-after skills for Data Analysts, Data Engineers, and Data Scientists, highlighting the top five skills for each role.
- **Skill Trends:** Examines how the demand for key skills, especially for Data Analysts, has changed over time.
- **Salary Insights:** Investigates salary distributions across major data roles and pinpoints the highest-paying and most in-demand skills for Data Analysts.

Visualizations and detailed insights help readers understand which skills to prioritize and how different roles compare in terms of compensation and requirements.

# Tools Used

- **Python**: Main programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization libraries for creating charts and plots.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for code, visualizations, and documentation.
- **Job Postings Dataset**: Source of real-world job and skill data for analysis.





# The Analysis
## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?
#### This project analyzes the most in-demand skills across various job titles in the U.S. job market. Using a dataset of job postings and their listed skills, it visualizes the top 5 skills for each role (e.g., Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Data Scientist), along with the percentage of postings that mention each skill.

### Visualize Data
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
        df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
        sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skill_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
        ax[i].set_title(job_title)
        ax[i].set_ylabel('')
        ax[i].set_xlabel('')
        ax[i].get_legend().remove()
        ax[i].set_xlim(0, 78)

        for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
                ax[i].text(v + 1, n, f'{v:.0f}%', va='center')

fig.suptitle('Likelihood of Skills Requested in US Job Postings', fontsize=15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=0.5) # fix the overlap

plt.show()
```

### Results
![Visualisation of Top skills for Data Nerds](Project/Images/skill_demand.png)

This visualization shows three horizontal bar charts titled Likelihood of Skills Requested in US Job Postings. Each chart represents the top five skills for three job roles: Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist. The bars indicate the percentage of job postings mentioning each skill, with percentages labeled at the end of each bar. 

For Data Analysts, SQL leads with 51%, followed by Excel at 41%, Tableau at 28%, Python at 27%, and SAS at 19%. For Data Engineers, SQL is at 68%, Python at 65%, AWS at 43%, Azure at 32%, and Spark at 32%. For Data Scientists, Python dominates at 72%, followed by SQL at 51%, R at 44%, SAS at 24%, and Tableau at 24%. The charts use a clean, professional style with a dark color palette, and the overall tone is informative and analytical.

### Insights
#### SQL is crucial across all three rolesâ€”most demanded for Data Engineers (68%) and also highly required for Data Analysts (51%) and Data Scientists (51%).

#### Python dominates Data Science roles (72%) and is also important for Data Engineering (65%) and Data Analysis (27%).

#### Excel is notably relevant for Data Analysts (41%) but not mentioned for the other roles.

#### Cloud and big data tools like AWS (43%), Azure (32%), and Spark (32%) are more prominent in Data Engineer roles.

#### Statistical tools like R and SAS are more common for Data Scientists (R: 44%, SAS: 24%) and Analysts (SAS: 19%).

#### Visualization tool Tableau appears for both Analysts (28%) and Scientists (24%).

## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysis?

### Visualize Data
```python
df_plot = df_DA_US_percent.iloc[:, :5]
sns.lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False, palette='tab10')
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine()
plt.xlabel('2023')
plt.legend().remove()
plt.title('Trending Top Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
plt.ylabel('Likelihood in Job Posting')

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter

ax = plt.gca()

ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter())

for i in range(5):
        plt.text(11.2, df_plot.iloc[-1, i], df_plot.columns[i])
```

## What I Learned

- Gained a comprehensive understanding of the current U.S. data job market, including which skills are most valued for Data Analysts, Data Engineers, and Data Scientists.
- Developed proficiency in using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
- Learned how to extract actionable insights from job postings and salary data to inform career decisions.
- Improved skills in communicating data-driven findings through clear visualizations and concise summaries.

## Challenges

- Cleaning and standardizing job postings and skill data from diverse sources required significant preprocessing effort.
- Identifying and categorizing skills consistently across different job titles was complex due to variations in terminology.
- Visualizing overlapping trends and salary distributions in a way that is both informative and easy to interpret took several iterations.
- Ensuring the analysis remained relevant and actionable for both aspiring and current data professionals.

## Conclusion
